   ```
3. **Configure Spotify Developer Dashboard:**
   - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/) and set up a new Spotify app.
   - Fill in the app's name and description, and select "Web API" and "Web Playback SDK".
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, add the IP address you'll be using to run the app (see below).
   - Once your app is created, copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the Spotify Developer Dashboard and paste them into your `.env` file.

---


<h2 id="running-the-app">‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App</h2>

1. **Start the App:**
   ```sh
   expo start
   ```
   - After starting, make a note of the IP address shown under the label `Metro waiting on:`. It should look something like:
    ```
    exp://10.124.188.108:8081
    ```
2. **Ensure correct Redirect URI setup in Spotify Developer Dashboard.**
   - Go back to your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/) and paste the noted IP address (from the `expo start` output) as the **Redirect URI** in the Spotify app settings.

<h2 id="common-issues">‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues</h2>

### **Access Token Expired**
   - If you authenticate with Spotify and get the error "The access token expired," try restarting the app.
   - This can happen when the token expires due to inactivity or long usage. Simply restarting the app should resolve the issue.
   - If the problem persists after restarting, reauthenticate and restart the app again.

### **Redirect URI Error**
   - If you encounter errors related to the Redirect URI, double-check that the IP address in your developer dashboard matches the one shown when you run `expo start`.
